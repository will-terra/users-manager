Quick overview
----------------

The backend is a Rails API application that provides JSON endpoints consumed by the React frontend. Key features:

- Authentication with Devise + devise-jwt (JWT issued at sign in/up and revoked on sign out).
- Authorization with Pundit (admin vs user access control).
- ActiveStorage for avatar uploads (local disk in development).
- Background jobs for imports and image processing (see `bin/jobs`).
- Realtime updates via ActionCable channels (admin stats, import progress).

Prerequisites
-------------

- Ruby 3.x (the project is compatible with the latest stable Ruby 3.x series used when it was developed)
- Bundler
- PostgreSQL (or the Docker Compose setup can provide Postgres)
- Node & Yarn/PNPM are required only if you want to compile frontend assets from the backend app (this repo uses a separate frontend app)

Local setup (without Docker)
----------------------------

1. Install dependencies and setup the database:

```bash
cd backend
bundle install
bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

2. Start the Rails server (default port used by the repo is 3001):

```bash
bundle exec rails s -p 3001
```

3. Start background job worker(s) to process imports and avatar processing:

```bash
# the repository includes `bin/jobs` for running jobs (it uses the configured queue adapter)
bin/jobs start
```

Run with Docker (recommended)
-----------------------------

This repository contains `docker-compose.yml` and Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend. The easiest way to run the full stack is using Docker Compose.

1. Build and start containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Create and migrate the database inside the running backend container (if not done automatically):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm backend bash -lc "bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate db:seed"
```

3. To run one-off commands inside the backend container (console, rails tasks):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm backend bash
# then run `bundle exec rails c` or similar
```

Background jobs
---------------

- Background jobs are required to process imported spreadsheets, download remote files (spreadsheet or avatar images), and to process image variants.
- Use the provided runner `bin/jobs` in development. When running via Docker, make sure the jobs service (configured in `docker-compose.yml`) is up.

ActiveStorage / uploads
-----------------------

- Development uses local disk storage for ActiveStorage (see `config/storage.yml`). For production, configure an object store (S3 or similar) and set the appropriate ENV vars.
- Uploaded avatars are attached to the user via `has_one_attached :avatar` and are processed by the `avatar_processing_job` after attach.

Tests and linters
-----------------

Run the backend test suite (RSpec):

```bash
cd backend
bundle exec rspec
```

RuboCop is available for style checks if configured in the repo. Run:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```

Configuration & environment variables
-------------------------------------

- `RAILS_ENV` — environment (development/test/production)
- `DATABASE_URL` — connection string used by Rails in production/docker setups
- `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` — master key for encrypted credentials (a `master.key` is included for local usage in this repo)
- `ACTION_CABLE_URL` — URL used by the frontend to connect to ActionCable sockets (set via `docker-compose.yml` for containers)

Check `config/environments/*.rb`, `config/credentials.yml.enc` and `config/storage.yml` for additional configuration points.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- If the frontend cannot authenticate, confirm the frontend is sending the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header returned by the sign in/up endpoints.
- If imports do not start, ensure the job worker is running and has access to the storage where files are attached.
- If ActiveStorage fails in Docker, check volume permissions and ensure the storage path exists and is writable.

Useful endpoints
----------------

- POST `/api/v1/sign_up` — create an account (first user becomes admin)
- POST `/api/v1/sign_in` — sign in (returns JWT and redirect path)
- GET `/api/v1/users` — admin-only user listing
- POST `/api/v1/user_imports` — upload or provide a remote URL to create a `UserImport`

If you need additional details (CI configuration, alternative queue adapters, or S3 setup), I can add them or create a small setup script to automate local setup.
